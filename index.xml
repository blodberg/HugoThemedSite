      <description>Hi! I&amp;rsquo;m Sri. ðŸ‘‹
I don&amp;rsquo;t really know how to best introduce myself, so here are some facts about me in no particular order:
I was born in Mumbai, moved to the US about 10 years ago and have been living in the New England region since.
I love traveling to new places and experiencing different cultures. I try to squeeze in a few trips every year whenever I can. In my free time, I like playing video games and watching TV shows.</description>
