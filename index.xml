      <description>Hi! I&amp;rsquo;m Sri. ðŸ‘‹
I don&amp;rsquo;t really know how to best introduce myself, so here are some facts about me in no particular order:
I was born in Mumbai, moved to the United States for education and have been living in the New England region for 10 years.
I am currently working as a Software Engineer in the healthcare tech industry, there&amp;rsquo;s always something new to learn.
I love traveling to new places and experiencing different cultures.</description>
